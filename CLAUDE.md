# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

DSE Program Management System — a modular monolith with a plugin registry, currently
implementing the RUPP course-specification syllabus (Part 1 programme reference +
Part 2 §1–25 course spec wizard) plus Students/Courses/Offerings/Lecturers CRUD.
Auth runs in one of two swappable modes behind `AUTH_MODE` — a local JWT dev-token
scheme for local/CI work, or real Supabase Auth — isolated in `core/auth/*` so plugin
code never depends on which is active.

## Commands

```bash
bun install                            # install all workspaces
bun run db:up                          # start Postgres via Docker (docker-compose.yml)
bun run --cwd apps/backend db:migrate  # apply Prisma migrations (dev)
bun run seed                           # seed dev users + sample data
bun run gen-token --role admin         # AUTH_MODE=dev only: mint a dev JWT (roles: admin | lecturer | student)

bun run dev                            # turbo: backend :4000 + frontend :3000 together
bun run build                          # turbo: build all workspaces
bun run lint                           # turbo: lint all workspaces (frontend only defines one, via next lint)
bun run typecheck                      # turbo: tsc --noEmit in every workspace
```

Testing: only `packages/shared-types` currently has tests (`bun:test`, files named
`*.test.ts`, colocated with the source they test — see `course-spec.test.ts`).
Run all of them with `bun test` from the repo root, or scope to one file with
`bun test src/course-spec.test.ts` from inside `packages/shared-types`.
`apps/backend` has a `test` script (`bun test`) wired for when it gains tests, but has none yet.

Deploy target/process (Supabase → Render → Vercel, and switching from dev-token to
Supabase Auth via `AUTH_MODE`) is documented in `DEPLOY.md`.

## Architecture

### Monorepo

Bun workspaces (`apps/*`, `packages/*`) + Turborepo. `packages/shared-types` is the
single source of truth for the plugin contract, permission strings, and every Zod
schema — both `apps/backend` and `apps/frontend` import it, so frontend/backend
payloads cannot drift. `packages/config` holds the shared `tsconfig.base.json` and
`theme.css` (the Tailwind v4 `@theme inline` mapping shared design tokens like
`--color-primary` onto utility classes); `packages/ui` holds shared React
primitives (DataTable, StatusBadge, TableToolbar, `@base-ui/react`-based inputs)
generated via the shadcn CLI (`bun run --cwd packages/ui ui:add <component>`,
style `base-luma` — see `packages/ui/components.json`). Actual brand colour
*values* (Noviq navy) live as CSS variables in `apps/frontend/app/globals.css`
(`:root` for light, `.dark` for dark — toggled by `next-themes`), not in
`packages/config`, so theming doesn't require touching the shared package.

### Plugin registry (backend)

Each domain (`students`, `courses`, `offerings`, `lecturers`, `methods`, `auth`) lives
under `apps/backend/src/plugins/<id>/` as `index.ts` (exports a `BackendPlugin` — the
shared `DSEPlugin` contract plus an Express router + service) + `router.ts` +
`service.ts`. `core/app.ts` is the only place
plugins are registered (`registry.register(...)`) and is deliberately domain-agnostic:
it just mounts every registered router at `/api/{id}` and serves `/api/registry` for
introspection. The frontend sidebar nav (`app/(shell)/sidebar.tsx` via
`navFromManifests`) is generated from that same manifest list, so a new plugin's nav
entry appears automatically once its manifest is added to `pluginManifests` in
`packages/shared-types/src/plugins.ts`. A manifest with no `routes` (like `auth`) is
registered and permission-gated but gets no sidebar entry — its actions are embedded
in another page's UI (auth's account-creation lives in the Lecturers page).

**Cross-plugin calls always go through `registry.get('<id>').service`** — never a
direct import between `plugins/*` directories. This is the in-process equivalent of
an API call and is what lets a plugin be added or removed without touching others
(see the "Adding a plugin later" section in `README.md`).

### Auth & permissions

`core/auth/token.ts` is the single swap-point. `getAuthMode()` reads `AUTH_MODE`
(default `dev`) and the two schemes coexist:

- **`dev`** — local HS256 tokens minted by `signToken` / `bun run gen-token` and
  verified whole by `verifyToken`. The token carries the role. Local dev and CI run
  in this mode with no live Supabase project.
- **`supabase`** — real Supabase-issued JWTs, verified against the project JWKS
  (`SUPABASE_JWKS_URL`) in `verifySupabaseToken`, which returns **identity only**
  (auth uid + email). The token is **never trusted for role**.

`core/auth/middleware.ts` (`requireAuth`) is the only place a raw token is read; it
sets `req.user: AuthUser` and every downstream check depends only on that shape. In
`supabase` mode `resolveSupabaseUser` looks the caller up in our own `User` table (by
`authId`, falling back to `email` and backfilling `authId` on first login — the
`user_auth_id` migration added that column), and **`User.role` is the authorization
source of truth** so Supabase metadata can never escalate a role. A valid Supabase
login with no provisioned `User` row is a 403 (`UnprovisionedAccountError`).

`core/permissions/index.ts` holds the single `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` map (role → permission
strings) and the `requirePermission(...)` guard factory — plugins declare which
permission a route needs, this map is the one auditable place deciding which roles hold
it. Every plugin router calls `requireAuth` then `requirePermission(...)` per route
(`"<id>:read"|"<id>:write"`, plus the admin-only `"accounts:create"`).

**Account provisioning** is the `auth` plugin. `GET /api/auth/me` returns the resolved
caller; `POST /api/auth/accounts` (admin-only, `accounts:create`) creates a lecturer
login via the Supabase **Admin API** (`inviteUserByEmail`, using the server-only
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — never shipped to the browser) and links it to an app
`User` row. There is no self-signup.

On the frontend, `lib/api.ts` is the single place the bearer token is attached:
`lib/supabase.ts` exposes `AUTH_MODE` (from `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_MODE`) and a lazily-built
browser client, so `dev` mode uses the static `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_TOKEN` and `supabase`
mode uses the live session access token. Login UI is `app/login/page.tsx`, the
authenticated shell is gated by `app/(shell)/auth-guard.tsx`, and `lib/auth.ts` wraps
the `auth` plugin calls (`me`, `createAccount`).

### Course Specification wizard

This is the largest and most active domain, defined entirely in
`packages/shared-types/src/course-spec.ts`:

- `SPEC_SECTIONS` is the ordered registry driving the wizard stepper (`id`, `title`,
  syllabus `ref` like `"§16"`, `part`, and `state: "ready" | "soon"` for
  not-yet-implemented sections). Storage is one `CourseSpec` row per course
  (`prisma/schema.prisma`), with `data[sectionId]` holding that section's opaque JSON
  and `status[sectionId]` tracking `draft`/`complete` so a lecturer can save one
  section and resume later.
- `SPEC_SECTION_SCHEMAS` maps a `SpecSectionId` to its Zod schema. The backend route
  `PUT /api/courses/:id/spec/:sectionId` (`plugins/courses/router.ts`) looks up the
  schema for the given section id and 400s if the section isn't implemented yet —
  this is the only validation gate for section saves, so adding a new section means
  adding its schema here and to `SPEC_SECTION_SCHEMAS`.
- Sections reference each other by stable code, not id: CLOs (§14) are `CLO1`,
  `CLO2`… by position; §15 CLO→PLO mapping rows and the §18 Weekly Plan's `cloCodes`
  both point back to a §14 CLO. Derived values cascade within a section: in §15 the
  lecturer enters SLT hours per CLO (validated to sum to the course-level total SLT),
  and Focus % / F-M-P are computed from each CLO's share of that total
  (`clo-mapping-section.tsx`). The **Weekly Plan** (§18, tab labelled "Weekly Plan",
  stored under the `slt` section key) is a week-by-week outline: one row per week with
  a topic, linked CLOs, learning activities, Contact Hours (L+T), Self-Study Hours, and
  Assessment/Deliverables. Weekly SLT is derived (`weekSlt` = Contact + Self-Study) and
  the footer totals each column. It **replaced** the old §16 mode/activity SLT grid, so
  the detailed physical/online/independent × L/T/P/O breakdown no longer exists; the
  Weekly Plan and §15 are independent. Frontend lives in `weekly-plan-section.tsx` +
  `add-week-dialog.tsx` + `weekly-plan-model.ts`.
- Reference constants (`PLOS`, `COGNITIVE_LEVELS`/`AFFECTIVE_LEVELS`/`PSYCHOMOTOR_LEVELS`,
  `FOCUS_LEVELS`, `LEARNING_ACTIVITIES`, `LETTER_GRADES`) back the dropdowns/inline guides
  and are fixed programme data, not user-editable — except `LEARNING_ACTIVITIES`, which
  is a starting vocabulary for the Weekly Plan's activity picker that lecturers can
  extend with their own entries.
- `TeachingMethod`/`AssessmentMethod` (the `methods` plugin) are global vocabularies
  shared across all courses that grow as lecturers add new methods from the §15 form
  — an add of an existing name reuses the row rather than duplicating it.

### Frontend

Next.js App Router. `app/(shell)/` is the authenticated shell (sidebar + topbar);
each plugin gets a route segment there. The course spec wizard lives under
`app/(shell)/courses/[id]/spec/`, one `*-section.tsx` file per wizard section plus
`spec-client.tsx` orchestrating the stepper. `lib/*.ts` (one file per plugin, e.g.
`students.ts`, `course-spec.ts`) wraps `lib/api.ts` with typed calls built on the
shared Zod schemas — this is the layer to extend when a plugin gains new endpoints.

Runs on **Next.js 16 / React 19** with Turbopack (`next.config.mjs` pins the
monorepo `root` so an unrelated parent-dir lockfile can't confuse it). Consequently
route `params`/`searchParams` are **async** — a page/layout must be `async` and
`await params` before reading it (see `courses/[id]/spec/page.tsx`); the old
synchronous `{ params }: { params: { id } }` shape no longer works.
